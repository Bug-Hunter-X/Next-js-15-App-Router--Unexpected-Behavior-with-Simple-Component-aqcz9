# Next.js 15 App Router Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior encountered when using a simple component in the Next.js 15 App Router's `pages` directory.  The issue arises when the component is relatively simple and no routing or dynamic content is involved.

## Bug Description:

When a basic component like the example `pages/index.js` is used, it might exhibit unexpected behavior (e.g., rendering issues or no rendering at all).  This behavior is not consistent and might depend on factors not easily identifiable.

## How to Reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.

Observe the behavior of the application.  The expectation is that a simple "Hello, world!" message would be displayed, but unexpected behavior might occur.

## Potential Causes (Speculative):

* **Caching issues:** Next.js might be encountering caching problems that prevent the component from rendering correctly.
* **Unclear behavior in App Router:** The App Router's behavior might be subtle or unexpected for extremely simple components.
* **Conflicting dependencies:** Although unlikely in this simple case, there might be a conflict with the other packages.

## Solution:

While the root cause isn't definitively identified, the solution demonstrates a workaround. A possible approach to overcome this is to slightly modify the component structure (as demonstrated in the solution file). This might trigger a correct behavior from the App Router.  The precise reason why this fixes the problem remains unclear, indicating a need for further investigation into the App Router's behavior.
